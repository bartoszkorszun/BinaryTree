# Binary tree

This project was mostly focused on building an BST and converting it to an balanced BST and comparing theirs height. Also there are included some operations on that trees.

## Project description

The main goal was to compare height of the BST before and after convertion to the balanced BST. 

### Why do you want to balance the tree?

In the unbalanced BST it is much easier to insert and delete nodes - it takes less time than in balanced BST, because programme does not have to monitor height of the tree.
On the other hand search time of an element is shorter in the balanced BST. 

## How to install and run the project

You can just download .zip from github, unpack it and run the .exe file.

### For programmers

I am using DEV C++ IDE for C++ development. In that case you should download contents of this repo and open the .dev file. After that you can hit the run button and it all should work properly. In case you are using other compiler you can create your own project and then copy contents of .cpp file.

## How to use Project:

The programme is pretty self-descriptive. There are options you can find:

1. Add node to the tree
2. Delete node from the tree
3. Add random array to the tree
4. Find the smallest and the biggest value of node
5. Show height of the tree
6. Transform unbalanced BST to balanced BST
7. Check if node exists
8. Delete whole tree
